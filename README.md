🚀 Excited to share my latest project — Mr AR, an AI Chatbot built using Grok (X.AI API)!

Over the past few days, I built "Mr AR", a conversational AI assistant using:

🤖 LLM: Grok via X.AI API (xai-... based access)

⚙️ Backend: Flask (Python)

🎨 Frontend: TailwindCSS + JavaScript (responsive & clean UI)

🔐 Secure API integration using .env and requests

💬 Mr AR can:

Engage in real-time conversations

Generate smart replies via Grok

Work in a responsive, all-in-one HTML/CSS/JS UI

Be extended for voice input, chatbot memory, and more

📚 Through this project, I deepened my skills in:

Full-stack AI development (frontend + backend)

Consuming external APIs securely

Working with Grok LLM and request-based integrations
